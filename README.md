# ZephyroCode Web

Hiya! This is my **Personal Web**, it works as portfolio and blog which I use to share my stories, thoughts, progress and some other stuff I want.

This one is based on the design made by [@midudev]('https://github.com/midudev') where I added my own information, changed _a bit_ some of the styles and tried to give it at least some of my personal touch.
