Hi there! Today I bring you my JavaScript notes!

This is a repo I've made so I can write down my notes, it's a way I'm using to learn some stuff and it's been working pretty well so far...

Of course, it's still a Work In Progress and I'll _probably_ update from time to time because I'll be updating stuff, making some corrections here and there... I wanted to share it, and it's been a while since the last time I posted something too.

I'm taking these notes in my local environment, so if I take some time to update it, _maybe_ it's because I forgot to.

These notes are divided in 2 sections:

- English notes
- Spanish notes

Both versions are basically the same, just translating them because I kinda want to use them for some teaching in the future... I do like a lot teaching.

Who knows, I may even make a course for web development... ðŸ¤”

Well, that's it for now, I guess... I'll be updating the notes repo so check it out!
