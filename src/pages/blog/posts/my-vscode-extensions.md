Hiya! I'm back with a new post. This time about my **Visual Studio Code Extensions**!

As you may know, I'm a _Frontend Web Developer_, and therefore, my VSCode Extensions are suited for that.

Some people often asks which ones I use, so here they are.

I'll be updating this post when I add/edit/delete one extension, so you can keep the track of it.

## ♦ [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)

This is an awesome tool, it allows you to highlight comments depending on your needs!

Some of the categories we have with this extension are:

- Alerts
- Queries
- TODO
- Highlights

And you can even make your own inside the extension settings!

I highly recommend this extension to make clear comments and make it easier to understand your code. It's been helping me a lot to organize my projects...

## ♦ [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)

This is an extension I mostly use when I'm running some of my tests or practices with **JavaScript**, **Python** and **C++**. It allows, as the name says, to run our code easily!

I can just write a code and then run it with this extension, and it's pretty useful.

Of course, this extension is up to you if you wanna use it. I do because of some kind of _"need"_, but even though it helps a lot.

## ♦ [ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets)

Well, this is the extension I use for **JavaScript Snippets**. It has a lot of useful snippets, and considering the fact that I use **React**... yeah.

If your plan is to learn **React**, then you'll love this extension. It'll make your coding easier!

---

## ♦ [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

Of course one of the best extensions that every **JavaScript** developer should use.

**ESLint** helps **A LOT** when we're coding. It shows your errors and would even tell you why it's a mistake.

You can improve a lot your code by using this extension, and it's one of the first extensions I'd recommend installing.

It also helps a lot when you're coding a project in a team because you can set the rules and all the team should follow them. Just... make sure ESLint is installed in your project as a dev dependency and also make sure you have your config file.

---

## ♦ [Git Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

**Git Lens**, the extension that _in my opinion_ is the best option to improve the **Git** integration in **VSCode**.

Some features this extension has are:

- Shows an inline ghost comment that tells you who made that change and when they did.
- Better commits view.
- Branch exploration.
- Repositories view.
- A Git Command pallette.

And of course it has many more features!

Highly recommended.

## ♦ [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

One of the most useful extensions you'd have.

This extension makes a dev server for you, so you get a "preview" of your web as if it were an actual host! It's really good if you're not using a framework that makes its own dev server.

Not gonna lie, this was the first extension I installed when I first started learning. And I absolutely loved it.

---

## ♦ [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

Yes, this. Prettier, the most popular formatter for a Web dev.

This extension helps you indent your code and organize it, so you don't have a messy _"thing"_ because that can't be called code.

Same as ESLint, make sure it's installed in your project and you have the settings when you're coding with a team.

Trust me, you want this extension.

## **Theme**

Now, as for color theme, I actually use my own theme. I made my own and of course it's available for everyone!

**Zephyr Nights Theme**

You can find it [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZephyroCode.zephyr-nights-theme).

I appreciate a lot if you download and rate my theme, that helps me a lot to give me motivation to keep working on it!
