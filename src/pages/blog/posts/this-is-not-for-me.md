Hi guys! Today I'm here to tell you how I deal with the feeling of not being good for this.

Sometimes we get the feeling that we're not learning anything, or you can even think that this is not _"your thing"_, so you get a drop in your motivation...

Honestly, I get that feeling pretty often. Some people asks me how do I deal with that, and well, that's why I'm writing this post.

As I said, I get that feeling pretty often, and it usually happens when I'm studying, so when I'm trying to learn, I randomly think _"Dude, maybe I'm not actually learning anything and I'm just wasting my time, maybe I shouldn't even try to be a developer"_ and then I have to force myself to keep trying. Otherwise, I'd get overwhelmed.

I tried some things, and there are 2 things that works pretty well to me:

1. Bubble Sessions
2. Goal higher than anything

Now you may be asking _"What on earth does that means?"_

Let's explain **Bubble Sessions** first.

A _"Bubble Session"_ is that time where **all** of your concentration is focused in one thing.

The _"Bubble effect"_ is that phenomenon in which you focus entirely on one thing, unconsciously ignoring all distractions, as your brain focuses you on one activity.

An example is when you're in a challenging videogame. There, you're completely focused and your mind ignores everything else so that you can focus.

During the bubble effect, your efficiency and learning ability is greatly improved, so you hardly feel hungry, thirsty, tired, sleepy, etc.

This effect can last for **hours**.

I force myself the bubble effect by eliminating immediate distractions from my immediate environment, such as my phone, a game and other stuff. I start studying and I stay immersed in that activity.

Once the bubble effect begins, you no longer worry about distractions, and you lose track of time, plus at the end, you have a much better knowledge and understanding of it than if you studied with "traditional" methods such as used in schools, or the well-known "Pomodoro".

_Please note that I have nothing agains the Pomodoro method. I like it, but it doesn't work pretty well for me. Remember this is my **personal experience**_.

Once I finish my study session with this effect, I proceed to recapitulate what I've learned and try my best to explain it to someone else, it can be your pet or an inanimate object. The point is to be able to teach or explain it, because that's where you confirm that you really learned.

About _"Goal higher than anything"_ it's pretty simple: you just place your goal above **everything** so you don't give up until you achieve it.

Of course both the Bubble Sessions and this option requires a decent self-control and discipline, but I can assure you that they work pretty fine...

Remember that you're learning programming, so you can't expect to be an expert in 1 day, or 1 week or even 1 year. This takes **a lot** of time, so you must invest a lot of time, patience and determination.

Even if you ever think that you're not good for this, trust me: **You are**. You can do it. And you **will** do it.
